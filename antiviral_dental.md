<ol> <li> <b>Primary infection.</b> About 90% of patients develop a flu-like illness, which coincides with <a href= https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/glossary/seroconversion> seroconversion</a>, between 2 and 4 weeks post exposure. Symptoms include fever, night sweats, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, diarrhea. The illness is self-limiting.

<li> <b>Asymptomatic phase.</b> Of variable duration, from 2 to 10 years. Patients are clinically well, but infectious.

<li> <b>Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). </b>Features:
	<ol>
		<li> Constitutional symptoms: fever, diarrhea, weight loss, skin rashes.
		<li> Immunodeficiency: increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections	
		<li> Neurological disease: dementia, myelopathy, peripheral neuropathy	
		<li> Rare malignancies: Kaposi sarcoma, oral hairy leukoplakia, or lymphoma

### Current [guidelines](https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/guidelines/adult-and-adolescent-arv/initiation-antiretroviral-therapy?view=full)

#### The <span id="yb"> Initiation </span> of Antiretroviral Therapy 

* Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for all persons with HIV 
	* reduce morbidity and mortality (AI) 
	* prevent the transmission of HIV to others (AI).

* The Panel recommends initiating ART immediately after HIV diagnosis
	* increase the uptake of ART and linkage to care, 
	* decrease the time to viral suppression for individual patients, 
	* improve the rate of virologic suppression among persons with HIV (AII).

* Educate patients (AIII)
	* the benefits of ART
	* to deploy strategies to optimize care engagement 
	* treatment adherence 

Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; 
Rating of Evidence: I = Data from randomized controlled trials; II = Data from well-designed nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; III = Expert opinion

## Antiretroviral Drug Selectivity

* NRTIs
	* Once phosphorylated by cellular kinases, NRTIs have greater affinity for viral reverse transcriptase than for cellular DNA polymerases.
* NNRTIs
	* Do not undergo phosphorylation
	* Have greater affinity for viral reverse transcriptase than for cellular DNA polymerases
* PIs
	* Greater affinity for HIV aspartyl protease than for human protease.
* Integrase Inhibitors
	* Much higher selectivity than other classes of anti-HIV drugs.

### [Current Guideline](https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/guidelines/adult-and-adolescent-arv/what-start-initial-combination-regimens-antiretroviral-naive?view=brief)

#### for treatment-naive patients

* Integrase inhibitor-based regimens 
 * <span id="drug"> Bictegravir </span> plus <span id="drug"> tenofovir alafenamide </span> plus <span id="drug"> emtricitabine </span> 
 * <span id="drug"> Dolutegravir </span> plus <span id="drug"> abacavir </span> plus <span id="drug"> lamivudine </span> — only for individuals who are HLA-B*5701 negative and without chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfection 
 * <span id="drug"> Dolutegravir </span> plus (<span id="drug"> emtricitabine </span> or <span id="drug"> lamivudine </span> ) plus (<span id="drug"> tenofovir alafenamide</span> or<span id="drug"> tenofovir disoproxil fumarate</span>) 
 * <span id="drug"> Dolutegravir </span> plus <span id="drug"> lamivudine </span> —except for individuals with HIV RNA >500,000 copies/mL, HBV co-infection, or in whom ART is to be started before the results of HIV genotypic resistance testing for reverse transcriptase or HBV testing are available.

An antiretroviral (ARV) regimen for a treatment-naive patient generally consists of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) administered in combination with a third active ARV drug from one of three drug classes: 1. an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), 2. a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), 3. a protease inhibitor (PI) with a pharmacokinetic (PK) enhancer (also known as a booster; the two drugs used for this purpose are cobicistat and ritonavir).

* Specific drug combinations
	* <span id="drug"> Cobicistat </span> plus <span id="drug"> Ritonavir </span> (both are CYP3A4 inhibitors)
	* <span id="drug"> Emtricitabine </span> plus <span id="drug"> Lamivudine </span> (these two drugs are very similar)

|&gamma;|Type II| IFNGR &Dagger;|Immunomodulation|
||

## Interferons 
### Antiviral effect 

* Type I has more potent antiviral effect. It can be produced in almost any cell type when it is infected with a virus. It is triggered by molecular patterns of characteristic of viral but not host components (e.g. viral 5'-triphosphorylated ssRNA and dsRNA). 
	* dsRNA is produced by positive-strand RNA viruses and DNA viruses, but not detectable by negative-strand RNA Viruses [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1472073/)

* Interferon alpha is generally active against the following viruses <i> in vitro</i>: 
	* <span style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 0.6em"> adenovirus; coronavirus; encephalomyocarditis virus; hepatitis B virus; hepatitis C virus (HCV); hepatitis D virus; herpes simplex virus type 1; herpes simplex virus type 2; human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); papillomavirus; poliovirus; rhinovirus; vaccinia virus; varicella-zoster virus; vesicular stomatitis virus; human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I).
</span>

* Induces immune responses, alter the expression of genes, cell surface markers, phagocytic activity, cytotoxicity, etc. 

* Exact mechanism remain unclear, but may include the induction of enzymes that interfer with key steps in the HBV life cycle, include those that degrade foreign, but not host DNA ([PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=24557838))

	* Cellular mRNA has a [5' methylated cap and a polyA tail](https://www.neb.com/-/media/nebus/page-images/tools-and-resources/feature-articles/fa_mindcaps_fig1_initiationloop.jpg)
	* Viral mRNA does not have a cap.
	* Cap-dependent endonuclease binds to the 5' methylated caps of cellular mRNAs
	and cleaves the cellular mRNAs' 10 to 15 nucleotides 3' to the cap structure. This cellular capped RNA fragment is used by the viral polymerase to prime the synthesis of viral mRNA. 	
	* Baloxavir is an inhibitor of this cap-dependent endonuclease
* Adverse effects:
	* headache, diarrhea, bronchitis

<div id="right">

* [FDA approves Remdesivir on 2020-10-22](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-treatment-covid-19)
* Indication
	* Treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adult and pediatric patients
* MoA 
	* Originally developed to treat Ebola virus 
	* Nucleoside analog of Adenosine
	* It is a prodrug, metabolized by carboxylesterase I to its triphosphate active form
	* Coronaviruses replication requires **RNA-dependent RNA polymerase**. These enzymes can incorporate remdesivir into new RNA strands. Shortly after adding remdesivir, the enzyme stops being able to add more RNA subunits. This halts viral genome replication.
* ADME ([review article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8308800/))
	* Administered as a slow i.v. infusion of a loading dose followed by a maintenance dose for 5 or 10 days
	* Eliminated in urine
* Adverse effects
	* GI symptoms, elevated transaminase levels (liver function), hypersensitivity
