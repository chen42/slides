## <font color="firebrick">1. </font> Are LLMs Finally Getting Citations Right?

- **The Test:** I asked Gemini 2.5 Pro to pick a suitable research area and generate a literature review prompt.
  - My additions: make it ~500 words and include PMIDs.

- **The Contenders:**
  - Gemini Pro 2.5 (with and without Deep Research)
  - OpenAI GPT-5
  - Claude Sonnet 4.5 (with and without the PubMed connector)

- **The Question:** How relevant are the PMIDs they generate?

## Need a Tool to Help with the Evaluation

- Expressing intent is sufficient for some coding tasks:
  - I want to hover over a PMID in a block of text and instantly see the paper's title, authors, and abstract.
  - I want it all in a single, shareable HTML file.
- Getting the Code: Many LLMs can help
  - Gemini CLI
  - Claude Code
  - OpenAI Codex
- Iterating and Refining
  - <a href="https://chen42.github.io/SourceCery/" target="_new"> SourceCery</a>
  - Adding a theme switcher, font size controls, a clear text button.

## The Prompt

<p align="left">

Please act as an expert in behavioral neuroscience. Your task is to generate a comprehensive literature review on the animal models designed to operationalize 'addiction-like' behavior by identifying a sub-population of animals that exhibit compulsive drug seeking. The review must be structured around the translational framework that uses **DSM-like criteria** to distinguish this vulnerable subset from the general population of drug-using animals. Please structure your review using the following distinct sections:

</p>

<font size="1">

- **Introduction: The Translational Gap**
  - Explain the limitations of standard drug self-administration models (e.g., fixed-ratio schedules) in modeling the full spectrum of human addiction.
  - Introduce the conceptual shift toward modeling the _transition_ to compulsion rather than just drug reinforcement.

- **Defining the 'Addiction-Like' Phenotype: The Three-Criteria Model**
  - Detail the **three core behavioral criteria** (often associated with the Deroche-Gamonet, Belin, and Piazza labs) used to identify this phenotype.
  - You must specifically define and explain how each is measured:
    - **High Motivation:** (e.g., progressive-ratio schedules).
    - **Continued Seeking Despite No-Drug Periods:** (e.g., resistance to extinction).
    - **Compulsive Seeking:** (e.g., resistance to punishment, such as a footshock contingency).

- **Key Neurobiological Findings in the 'Addicted' Subset**
  - Summarize the primary neuroadaptations that have been consistently shown to differentiate this 'addiction-like' cohort from their 'non-addicted' counterparts.
  - Focus on key findings in **prefrontal-striatal circuits** (e.g., changes in the dorsal striatum, hypofrontality).

- **Significance and Limitations**
  - Conclude by summarizing the major contribution of this model to understanding the neurobiology of vulnerability versus resilience to addiction.
  - Briefly mention any common critiques or limitations of this approach."

## Gemini 2.5 Pro

#### (Released June 17, 2025)

<table> <tr> <td width="40%"> <img src="./images/ctc2025/2025-10-22-gemini.png"></td><td>

- **Without Deep Research:**
  - Cited only four papers, and just one was marginally relevant.
- **With Deep Research:**
  - Produced a much longer report, pulling from about 50 websites and citing 20 web-based papers.
  - When asked to convert links to PMIDs, most citations pointed to just one or two papers, and some PMIDs were irrelevant.
- AI Studio (Grounded with Google Search):
  - Results were similar to Deep Research, linking to webpages, converted PMIDs had the same issues.

## <font color="firebrick">3. </font> Hypothesis Generation

### Found a great QTL, but there are 10 genes under the peak. Need to read all the literature about these genes to generate a hypothesis about the causal gene.

- Search PubMed
  - Think about a complete list of keywords related to the phenotypes.
  - Search each gene against each of these keywords.
  - Read the abstracts.
  - Take notes on what is relevant.
  - Synthesize the knowledge

## Hypothesis Evaluation Results

### <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c46UYfp3DVfnEMBhSNb_QWXyWP7SQktOTq0QZZGAoPA/edit?usp=sharing"  target="_new"> Full report</a>

Reduced 99 pages of relevant sentences into 2.5 pages of structured summary, with likely valid citations.

**Summary of Supporting Evidence:**

The evidence supporting CACNA1C as a plausible causal gene for socially acquired nicotine intravenous self-administration is **substantial**. The strongest lines of evidence are: **1.** Its critical role in reward processing, learning, and memory, which are core components of addiction (PMID: 25290268, 28604818). **2.** Its expression and function in key brain regions of the reward pathway, such as the nucleus accumbens (PMID: 28165117). **3.** Its position as a hub gene in addiction-related molecular networks (PMID: 36744178, 36865068). **4**. Existing genetic associations with nicotine dependence and other substance use disorders in humans (PMID: 25555482, 36551763).
